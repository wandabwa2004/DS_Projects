## Python
### 1. [Financial Crime Fraud Analytics](https://github.com/wandabwa2004/Fraud_Analytics){:name='financial_'}
[Repository](https://github.com/wandabwa2004/Fraud_Analytics) | [Notebook](https://github.com/wandabwa2004/Fraud_Analytics/blob/master/Fraud%20Detection%20.ipynb) | [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/wandabwa2004/Fraud_Analytics/blob/master/Fraud%20Detection%20.ipynb)
* Descriptive and Predictive Analytics for a Synthetic dataset on Financial crimes. 
* The dataset https://www.kaggle.com/ntnu-testimon/paysim1/download is a synthetic one i.e. simulated using PaySim based on a sample of real transactions extracted from one month of financial logs from a mobile money service implemented in an African country. The dataset is scaled down 1/4 of the original dataset.
* Used [sweetviz](https://pypi.org/project/sweetviz/) package for  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
* Identified the  most probable fraud  indicators.
* XGBoost and  RandomForest Classifiers with Area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) as the  metric  for the skewed dataset.

### Conclusion:
1. Fraud detection is a difficult process. This is especially compounded by the lack of integral data in the area.
2. Tree based algorithms worked better in detection of fraud. This is partly attributed to the nature of data.

### 2. [Political Content Sentiment Analyzer](https://github.com/wandabwa2004/sent_analyzer_kenya)  
In this  project, I setup a tweets  collection framework for tweets belonging to five politicians in Kenya. I analyzed the tweet sentiments/emotions over time, packaged the same in a Streamlit App and hosted the same on Heroku.

* Collection of streaming tweets from Auckland and Wellington, New Zealand's largest cities during  COVID-19 Lockdown period. 
* Descriptive analytics on the tweeting patterns by users from the  two cities. Aucklanders seemed to work more than tweet. 
* Topics of discussion were  semantically identical across the cities. Visualized by PyLDAVis.

The objective of the competition is to create a machine learning model to help Kenyan non-profit organization Local Ocean Conservation anticipate the number of turtles they will rescue from each of their rescue sites as part of their By-Catch Release Programme https://zindi.africa/competitions/sea-turtle-rescue-forecast-challenge.
* Descriptive analytics and  EDA for the dataset. Included encoding etc for better modelling. 
* 1.1897261428182493 RMSE as the measurement metric.

* Collection of  tweets from the different cities via geocoding. 
* Translation via  GoogleTranslate Python library for modelling.
* Descriptive analytics of the datasets per country. 
* Modelling  via  BERT and batch sentiment prediction per tweet and grouped by cities. 
* The highest probability to a sentiment was assumed to be the true sentiment of the  tweet.

### 8. We are just a Loquacious lot. 2019 Kenyan Social Beat 
[Article](https://medium.com/@hermanwandabwa/we-are-just-a-loquacious-lot-2019-kenyan-social-beat-458938d5a066?source=friends_link&sk=a8d224ee3022decff6b78a4b5f9f8846)

The project was an anlytical piece about what Kenyans really discuss online. Data in form of  tweets was from January to December 2019. 

Questions of Interest:-
1. Are we able to deduce the nature of Kenyans based on their daily chatter? Do they talk about substantive issues?
2. Are they topically consistent in their talk over time?

* Descriptive Analytics of Uhuru Kenyatta's State of  the  Nation speeches from 2014 - 2019. 
* The language in Uhuru Kenyatta's State of the Nation addresses from 2014-2019 never changed.
* His 2015's speech was the most difficult in terms of readability i.e. needed someone at postgraduate/ advanced undergraduate level to read and probably understand.
* His 2019 speech was the most positive of all his speeches
