# Projects
## Python
<h2>  <a id="sharepointuploader" href="https://github.com/wandabwa2004/SharepointUploader"> 1.Sharepoint 365 Uploader </a> </h2>

[Repository](https://github.com/wandabwa2004/SharepointUploader)

Tool designed and developed using Python and Streamlit to help you upload files to an online Sharepoint location. This works with Sharepoint 365 but can be modified to fit earlier SharePoint versions. Current functionality includes:

* Specifying the folder path to the files to be  uploaded (Source URL).
* Summary information of the files to be  uploaded. 
* Specification of Sharepoint login and related upload details. 
* Creation of  a folder based on the todays date format in the base URL that is user specified.
* Upload of the files matching  the  specified extension (currently .xlsx) to the  new folder in the base URL. File format can be changed

![Sharepoint Uploader](https://github.com/wandabwa2004/SharepointUploader/blob/main/sharepoint.png "Correlation of factors in financial crime")
## Notes on Usage
* A deployed version of  the app can be found here https://sharepointuploader.herokuapp.com/. The app can also be cloned and run locally using streamlit: `streamlit run SharepointUploader.py`. When doing this, ensure you have the required modules listed in the requirements file.
* Make sure  the account  details for  accessing  Sharepoint on your  domain are valid. Normally, the username  is your domain specific email and password. 

## Bugs, Enhancements and Comments
All comments, bug reports and enhancement requests are welcome. To do so, please submit a new issue and I will work hard on improving the app. 

## Future Functionality
Future functionality will likely include:
* Option to specify file formats  to be uploaded in a folder with mixed file types. 
* Email trigger to the  username once  the files are all uploaded. 

<h2>  <a id="financialscrime" href="https://github.com/wandabwa2004/Fraud_Analytics"> 2.Financial Crime Fraud Analytics </a> </h2>

[Repository](https://github.com/wandabwa2004/Fraud_Analytics) | [Notebook](https://github.com/wandabwa2004/Fraud_Analytics/blob/master/Fraud%20Detection%20.ipynb) | [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/wandabwa2004/Fraud_Analytics/blob/master/Fraud%20Detection%20.ipynb)
* Descriptive and Predictive Analytics for a Synthetic dataset on Financial crimes. 
* The dataset https://www.kaggle.com/ntnu-testimon/paysim1/download is a synthetic one i.e. simulated using PaySim based on a sample of real transactions extracted from one month of financial logs from a mobile money service implemented in an African country. The dataset is scaled down 1/4 of the original dataset.
* Used [sweetviz](https://pypi.org/project/sweetviz/) package for  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
* Identified the  most probable fraud  indicators.
* XGBoost and  RandomForest Classifiers with Area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) as the  metric  for the skewed dataset.

### Conclusion:
1. Fraud detection is a difficult process. This is especially compounded by the lack of integral data in the area.
2. Tree based algorithms worked better in detection of fraud. This is partly attributed to the nature of data.

<h2>  <a id="politicalsentiment" href="https://github.com/wandabwa2004/sent_analyzer_kenya"> 3. Political Content Sentiment Analyzer </a> </h2>

In this  project, I setup a tweets  collection framework for tweets belonging to five politicians in Kenya. I analyzed the tweet sentiments/emotions over time, packaged the same in a Streamlit App and hosted the same on Heroku.

* Collection of streaming tweets from Auckland and Wellington, New Zealand's largest cities during  COVID-19 Lockdown period. 
* Descriptive analytics on the tweeting patterns by users from the  two cities. Aucklanders seemed to work more than tweet. 
* Topics of discussion were  semantically identical across the cities. Visualized by PyLDAVis.

[Article](https://medium.com/@hermanwandabwa/we-are-just-a-loquacious-lot-2019-kenyan-social-beat-458938d5a066?source=friends_link&sk=a8d224ee3022decff6b78a4b5f9f8846)

The project was an anlytical piece about what Kenyans really discuss online. Data in form of  tweets was from January to December 2019. 

Questions of Interest:-
1. Are we able to deduce the nature of Kenyans based on their daily chatter? Do they talk about substantive issues?
2. Are they topically consistent in their talk over time?
